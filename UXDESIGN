User Experience Design for Gala Manager

A.  Guest page

Guest page or tab has a data table with guests.  Columns include bidder number,
name, host, contact info, payment method, whether checked in, pledged amount,
paid amount, and a flag showing special request info.  The table may be sorted
by bidder number, name, or host.  When sorted by name, seats without a name are
sorted immediately after the host.  When sorted by host, the host's row is
first, followed by other rows with names in name order, followed by rows with no
name.  When sorted by bidder number, rows with the same bidder number are
further sorted by name.  The table is searchable; numeric search terms filter on
the bidder number and non-numeric search terms filter on either the name or the
host.

From this page, one can:
  - Edit any of the information about a guest (except pledged/paid amounts).
  - Add a new guest.
  - Remove a guest (if they have made no purchases).
  - Check in a guest or a set of guests.
  - Generate program labels
  - Generate check in forms
  - Export as CSV?

B.  Item page

The item page (or tab) has a data table with purchasable items (or donation
levels).  Columns include title, charge amount (could be "auction"), and value.
The table is always sorted by title.  The table is searchable, filtering on the
title.

From this page, one can:
  - Edit any of the information about an item.
  - Add an item.
  - Remove an item (if there are no purchases of it).
  - Enter or remove pledges or winning bids for an item.

C.  Charges page

The charges page (or tab) has a grouped data table, with one group for each
payer, and one row in that group for each purchase to be paid by that payer.
The columns include item title, guest (if not same as payer), charge amount,
payment menthod, and whether or not paid.  Each row can expand to show the list
of payments and refunds associated with that purchase.

From this page, one can:
  - Revoke a pledge for an item, removing that purchase line (if not paid).
  - Change the payment method for a line.
  - Charge or refund a line, if its payment method is card-on-file.
  - Mark a purchase paid by a non-card method.
